Furthermore, a monthly and daily trend analysis was done to see that orders were the highest on Fridays and weekends. A visual heat map of day and time confirmed these finidngs and shows that most orders on weekdays were placed between 12-1pm. 

Classic category and large pizza's contributed to the greatest sales.
